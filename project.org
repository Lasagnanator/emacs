* Observations

** Unclear behaviours and functions

Electric indent is a mistery.
Still a mistery why I can't bind /CTRL-;/ to the same function as /ESC/, maybe I should bind it directly to /ESC/.
The thing above is... Done I guess?

** Packages I like

Projectile seems like a really good package, but I find its integration with treemacs chaotic.
It needs some polish.
